# WhatToBake - api

The api for the WhatToBake project. It uses neo4j as database and its written fully in java with spring boot. 


## About the project
You have some products but you dont know **what to bake**?
With this brand new app users will be able to search for recipes and products with advanced filters 
for example by the products they have, the recipes they like, categories, tags and so much more. App will be accesible in the web browser and on mobiles. 

## Auth
I use pocketbase as user service. Its not yet connected to listen for user changes in order to update the main database with new users.
